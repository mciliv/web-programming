	<h2>Bio</h2>

	<body>
		<p>
	I love bio. Bio tells the story of life and a bio tells the story of
	someone's life. I'm about life and I'm also about peoples lives. I love
	to help out others. I also love learning about how we work.
		</p>
		<p>
	How about what I just said? What was my process of thinking? This is where
algorithms come to play in the game of life. Algorithms are what allow us to
play the game, to have a controller into the way that life works, and to take
control of our lives through consciousness.
		</p>
		<p>
I'm conscious, or at least conscious that I'm learning everyday, so that
I can live and give better.
