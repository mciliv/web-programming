# README for Morgan Ciliv's website

By: Morgan Ciliv
Date: 9 Feb 2016

This website is my personal website which can also be accessed from

http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~mciliv01/

1. I have correctly implement the functionality of linking to my bio and
to my resume. I've included appropriate information. Everything is working
as intended so far, but I have a lot more I want to add and I want to fix
up the styling.

2. I collaborated with Vincent Tsang and Jim Mao.

3. I spent more than 12 hours completing the assingment.


Notes:

The resume is slightly out of date, but slightly more detailed.

To publish my website I need to remember...
git push -u origin master
