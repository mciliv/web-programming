## Overview

1. The purpose of this git repository is to be able to have git version-control. Having a repository allows us to store files on the web so that we can use git effectively. Version-control is a powerful development tool because it allows users to manage their versions accurately and with great percision. The user of git version-control can choose what versions they want to update and store files in multiple different ways so that every change and file that's useful is kep track of. If mistakes are made, it is easy to revert back to a previous version.

2. My favorite assignment was the personal website (Assignment 1). This assignment allowed me to make something that I will use in the future. I have this personal website now, and now that I've learned more from all the other work, I can go and make changes and updates.

3. Wow. I'm so excited that I have insight into how the web, something I use every single day, works! I'm able to figure out what I need to do to find something on the web. I know many more tools as a programmer. Also, I have a feeling of how everything connects and how computers interact. This class enabled me to make connections is a very large scope which makes me more knowledgeable in how many of the tools I use often work.

4. The most important thing I learned in this course was how client server works in all the different contexts we learned. For example, in assignment 3, it was helpful to understand how client sends a request to the server and the server sends a response back. Also, the server sends a request to the database and the database sends a response to the server.

5. I would like to delve deeper into programming with python. It sounds like python is quite a broad and effective language. I learned that it is used in server-side web development but also machine learning which is what I'm really interested in.
